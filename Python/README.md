This repository contains sample projects to outline competency in various Data Analytics tools. It is a work in progress and contains samples that include Covid, Hockey and others.

## Main Folders

### Covid
TODO: Covid Analyses
Since Covid has been a huge part of everyday life, a Covid analysis seemed prudent. Data was obtained from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University [Github Repository](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

### Hockey
TODO: Hockey Analyses
As a hockey player and fan, doing analyses of hockey related data is a fun exercise.

Data gathering from NHL.com has not been started yet.

### Misc
TODO: Misc Analyses
Any project that does not fit into the above categories will be housed here.
